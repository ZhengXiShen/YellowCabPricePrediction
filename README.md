Our topic is "How to evaluate the cost of a ride in New York?"   

We tentatively plan to study the relationship between the cost of parameters other than distance and price through classification firstly. Building a machine learning model to predict the cost of taxi rides in New York City could be a valuable tool for both taxi companies and customers. By training a model on historical data, we could identify the factors that most influence taxi fares, such as passenger number, time of day, and location. This model could help companies optimize their pricing strategies, as well as assist customers in budgeting for their trips. Additionally, a predictive model could allow for more accurate and transparent pricing, improving the trust and satisfaction of both drivers and riders. The data set includes the time period of the ride, the number of passengers, payment method, tip amount, final price, distance, total time, etc. We use classification for these parameters and filter out strongly related parameters by comparing their performance. Then we use the selected parameters to build models with regression for each class. As for now, we plan to process the data using techniques such as transforming dummy variables and discretization. Then we perform feature selection by ElasticNet to avoid factors that affect the accuracy of the model such as multicollinearity. Finally, a tunned random forest model will be trained to perform linear prediction of cost of rides.
